# DoS-Secure-DNS-Server
The project focuses on exploring data replication among multiple DNS servers to boost resilience against localized denial of service (DoS) attacks. The primary objective is to evaluate how data replication within DNS infrastructure can mitigate DoS threats by avoiding single points of failure, thus improving overall service resilience.
